Nanopond is just what it says: a very very small and simple artificial
life virtual machine.
</p>

It is a "small evolving program" based artificial life system of the same
general class as Tierra, Avida, and Archis.
</p>

<h1>How Nanopond works:</h1>

The Nanopond world is called a <em>pond</em>. It is an NxM two dimensional
array of <em>cell</em> structures, and it wraps at the edges (it's toroidal).
Each cell has an energy, a genome ( that is an array of POND_DEPTH four-bit
values), an id and a parent id. Dead cell's have an id of zero.
</p>

The first four bit value in the genome is called the <em>logo</em>. What that is
for will be explained later. The remaining four bit values each code for
one of 16 instructions:


<ul>
    <li>ZERO (0x0): Zero VM state registers</li>
    <li>FWD (0x1): Increment the pointer (wrap at end)</li>
    <li>BACK (0x2): Decrement the pointer (wrap at beginning)</li>
    <li>INC (0x3): Increment the register</li>
    <li>DEC (0x4): Decrement the register</li>
    <li>READG (0x5): Read into the register from genome</li>
    <li>WRITEG (0x6): Write out from the register to genome</li>
    <li>READB (0x7): Read into the register from buffer</li>
    <li>WRITEB (0x8): Write out from the register to buffer</li>
    <li>LOOP (0x9): Jump forward to matching REP if register is zero</li>
    <li>REP (0xa): Jump back to matching LOOP if register is nonzero</li>
    <li>TURN (0xb): Turn in the direction specified by register</li>
    <li>XCHG (0xc): Skip next instruction and exchange value of register with it</li>
    <li>KILL (0xd): Blow away neighboring cell if allowed with penalty on failure</li>
    <li>SHARE (0xe): Equalize energy between self and neighbor if allowed</li>
    <li>STOP (0xf): End execution</li>
</ul>

The instructions are exceptionless and lack fragile
operands. This means that any arbitrary sequence of instructions will
always run and will always do something. This is called an evolvable
instruction set, because programs coded in an instruction set with these
basic characteristics can mutate. The instruction set is also
Turing-complete, which means that it can theoretically do anything any
computer can do.
</p>

At the center of Nanopond is a core loop. Each time this loop executes,
a clock counter is incremented and one or more things happen:

<ul>
    <li>Every INFLOW_FREQUENCY clock ticks a random (x,y) location is picked,
        energy is added (see INFLOW_RATE_MEAN and INFLOW_RATE_DEVIATION)
        and it's genome is filled with completely random bits. Statistics
        are also reset to generation==0 and parentID==0 and a new cell ID
        is assigned.
    </li>
    <li>Every tick a random (x,y) location is picked and the genome inside is
        executed until a STOP instruction is encountered or the cell's
        energy counter reaches zero. (Each instruction costs one unit energy.)
    </li>
</ul>

The cell virtual machine is an extremely simple register machine with
a single four bit register, one memory pointer, one spare memory pointer
that can be exchanged with the main one, and an output buffer. When
cell execution starts, this output buffer is filled with all binary 1's
(0xffff....). When cell execution is finished, if the first byte of
this buffer is *not* 0xff, then the VM says "hey, it must have some
data!". This data is a candidate offspring; to reproduce cells must
copy their genome data into the output buffer.
</p>

When the VM sees data in the output buffer, it looks at the cell
adjacent to the cell that just executed and checks whether or not
the cell has permission (see below) to modify it. If so, then the
contents of the output buffer replace the genome data in the
adjacent cell. Statistics are also updated: parentID is set to the
ID of the cell that generated the output and generation is set to
one plus the generation of the parent.
</p>

A cell is permitted to access a neighboring cell if:
<ul>
    <li>That cell's energy is zero</li>
    <li>That cell's parentID is zero</li>
    <li>That cell's logo (remember?) matches the trying cell's <em>guess</em></li>
</ul>

Since randomly introduced cells have a parentID of zero, this allows
real living cells to always replace them or eat them.
</p>

The guess is merely the value of the register at the time that the
access attempt occurs.
</p>

Permissions determine whether or not an offspring can take the place
of the contents of a cell and also whether or not the cell is allowed
to EAT (an instruction) the energy in it's neighbor.
</p>

If you haven't realized it yet, this is why the final permission
criteria is comparison against what is called a "guess." In conjunction
with the ability to "eat" neighbors' energy, guess what this permits?
</p>

Since this is an evolving system, there have to be mutations. The
MUTATION_RATE sets their probability. Mutations are random variations
with a frequency defined by the mutation rate to the state of the
virtual machine while cell genomes are executing. Since cells have
to actually make copies of themselves to replicate, this means that
these copies can vary if mutations have occurred to the state of the
VM while copying was in progress.
</p>

What results from this simple set of rules is an evolutionary game of
<em>corewar</em>. In the beginning, the process of randomly generating cells
will cause self-replicating viable cells to spontaneously emerge. This
is something I call <em>random genesis</em>, and happens when some of the
random gak turns out to be a program able to copy itself. After this,
evolution by natural selection takes over. Since natural selection is
most certainly not random, things will start to get more and more
ordered and complex (in the functional sense). There are two commodities
that are scarce in the pond: space in the NxM grid and energy. Evolving
cells compete for access to both.
</p>

Nanopond, for it's simplicity, manifests some really interesting
evolutionary dynamics. While I haven't run the kind of multiple-
month-long experiment necessary to really see this (I might!), it
would appear that evolution in the pond doesn't get stuck on just
one or a few forms the way some other simulators are apt to do.
I think simplicity is partly reponsible for this along with what
biologists call embeddedness, which means that the cells are a part
of their own world.
</p>

Run it for a while... the results can be... interesting!
</p>

Have fun!
